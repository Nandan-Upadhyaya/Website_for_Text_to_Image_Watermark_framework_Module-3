# 🖼️ User Gallery Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** ✅
The database already had the necessary tables:
- `GeneratedImage` - Stores AI-generated images with prompts
- `EvaluatedImage` - Stores evaluated images with scores
- `WatermarkedImage` - Stores watermarked images with settings

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints** ✅

Created `server/gallery_routes.py` with the following endpoints:

- **GET `/api/gallery/generated`** - Fetch user's generated images
  - Supports pagination (page, per_page)
  - Returns images with prompt, dataset, timestamp

- **GET `/api/gallery/evaluated`** - Fetch user's evaluated images
  - Supports pagination
  - Returns images with score, prompt, timestamp

- **GET `/api/gallery/watermarked`** - Fetch user's watermarked images
  - Supports pagination
  - Returns images with watermark text, position, opacity

- **GET `/api/gallery/stats`** - Get user's gallery statistics
  - Returns counts for generated, evaluated, watermarked, and total images

- **GET `/api/gallery/image/<filename>`** - Serve gallery images
  - Securely serves images from gallery directories

### 3. **Automatic Image Saving** ✅

Modified existing endpoints to automatically save images for authenticated users:

#### **Generate Images** (`/api/generate`)
- Detects authenticated users via JWT token
- Saves generated images to `generated_images/` directory
- Stores metadata: prompt, dataset, timestamp
- Works with both DFGAN and vehicle generation

#### **Watermark Images** (`/api/watermark/apply`)
- Detects authenticated users via JWT token
- Saves watermarked images to `watermarked_images/` directory
- Stores metadata: watermark text, position, opacity, timestamp

### 4. **User Gallery UI** ✅

Created `src/pages/UserGallery.js` with:

#### **Features:**
- ✅ **Three Tabs**: Generated, Evaluated, Watermarked images
- ✅ **Statistics Dashboard**: Shows counts for each category
- ✅ **Image Grid**: Beautiful responsive grid layout
- ✅ **Image Details**: Displays prompt, settings, timestamp for each image
- ✅ **Download Button**: Download any image with one click
- ✅ **Pagination**: Navigate through pages of images (12 per page)
- ✅ **Dark Mode Support**: Fully compatible with dark theme
- ✅ **Authentication Guard**: Requires sign-in to view gallery

#### **UI Elements:**
- Beautiful stat cards with icons
- Tab navigation for different image types
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Empty state messages
- Loading indicators
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

### 5. **Navigation** ✅

- Added Gallery link to Navbar (already existed)
- Updated App.js route to use new UserGallery component
- Gallery accessible at `/gallery`

## 🎯 How It Works

### **For Users:**

1. **Generate Images:**
   - User logs in
   - Generates images on `/generate` page
   - Images are automatically saved to their gallery
   
2. **Apply Watermarks:**
   - User logs in
   - Watermarks images on `/watermark` page
   - Watermarked images are automatically saved to gallery

3. **View Gallery:**
   - Navigate to `/gallery`
   - See all their generated and watermarked images
   - Filter by tabs (Generated, Evaluated, Watermarked)
   - View prompts, settings, and timestamps
   - Download any image

### **For Anonymous Users:**
- Can still generate and watermark images
- Images are NOT saved to gallery (no authentication)
- Must sign in to access gallery features
