## How Each Module Works

### Module 1 — DF-GAN Text-to-Image (Standalone)
- What it is:
  - A text-to-image GAN that synthesizes images from natural language prompts. 

- Inputs:
  - Prompt(s): tokenized via DAMSM vocabulary.
  - Noise Vector: z_dim (default 100), batch size, truncation/trunc_rate, manual_seed, encoder_epoch; dataset-specific text/image encoders.

- Outputs:
  - Generated PNGs (normalized from [-1,1] to [0,255]) saved per-sentence. Training also writes periodic grids and checkpoints to saved_models folder.
  - Metrics/artifacts: FID computed with 2048-dim Inception features against npz stats.
  - optional CLIP alignment grid and score saved under alignment_samples.

- Key components:
  - Text Encoder : bi-LSTM that returns word- and sentence-level embeddings (256).

  - Image encoder : (CNN_ENCODER): Inception v3 backbone projecting image features to 256-d, used by DAMSM and dataset prep.

  - Generator:
    - noise z → fc to 8·nf·4×4 → stack of G_Block(up-sample) layers (get_G_in_out_chs) → to_rgb → Tanh.
    - Text conditioning via DFBLK + Affine: concatenates [z, sent_emb] and modulates feature maps in each block.

  - Discriminator:
    - NetD extracts multi-scale features with D_Block downsamplers.
    - NetC concatenates image features with sentence embedding (spatially replicated) to produce a conditional real/fake logit.
    - Losses use hinge; includes mismatched text negatives.
   - Regularization: Matching-Aware Gradient Penalty on image/text gradients.
   - Stabilization: Exponential Moving Average of G, EMA weights are used for testing/FID.

  - Evaluation:
    - FID: InceptionV3 2048-d features vs dataset npz.
    - CLIP alignment (optional diagnostic): generates a grid and cosine scores for prompts using ViT-B/32 CLIP pre-trained model.

### Module 2 — CLIP-based Image Prompt Evaluator (Standalone)
- What it is:
  - A Python module that evaluates image–prompt alignment using CLIP ViT-B/32, with enhanced keyword analysis, contradiction checks, and score normalization.

- Inputs:
  - image_path: path to a PNG/JPEG/WebP image.
  - prompt: natural-language text.
  
- Outputs (dict):
  - overall_score, original_score, percentage_match, original_percentage, raw_percentage
  - quality (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor), feedback, prompt
  - keyword_analysis: [{ keyword, present, confidence, raw_score, status, status_type }]
  - meets_threshold: bool
  - detailed_metrics: { raw_score, penalized_score, average_score, normalized_score, percentage, all_scores }
  - contradiction_warning (if penalty applied)
  - missing_feature_analysis: { present_features|weak_features|missing_features (with importance_weight, confidence, raw_score), counts }
  - missing_feature_feedback, missing_feature_penalty, penalty_percentage

- How it works (from code):
  - CLIP ViT-B/32 encodes image and multiple prompt variants (“a photo of …”, “an image showing …”, cleaned prompt); uses best similarity.
  - Applies semantic contradiction penalties for conflicting concepts if contradiction score exceeds the main score by a margin.
  - Extracts important keywords via NLTK (POS tagging, stopwords), boosts animals/living things using WordNet, and assigns importance weights.
  - Probes each keyword with multiple templates to classify present/weak/missing.
  - Computes a weighted missing-feature penalty; combines with contradiction penalty and recalculates normalized percentage.
  - Normalizes raw CLIP scores to 0–100% with calibrated bands and maps to quality:
    - Excellent > 0.28, Good > 0.22, Fair > 0.18, else Poor.

### Module 3 — Watermark UI (Standalone)

**Visible Watermarking:**

- Features:
  - Add image or text watermarks to multiple images at once.
  - Customizable position (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right, Center), opacity, scale (auto-resize), rotation, and padding (px or %).
  - Real-time preview and batch output with file renaming options.
- Inputs:
  - Images: selected via folder picker or multi-file selection.
  - Watermark: image or text, with options for font, color, and size.
  - Options: position, opacity, scale, rotation, padding, output naming.
- Outputs:
  - Watermarked images saved to the chosen output directory, with optional prefix/suffix renaming.

**Command to run the app :**
python FreeMark.py

**Invisible Watermarking (DWT-DCT):**

  - Embeds a binary watermark (text or image) into the host image using a combination of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
  - The watermark is binarized and adapatively resized to fit the host image's embedding capacity.
  - Embedding is performed in the DCT coefficients of the DWT-LL subband, with redundancy for robustness.
  - Extraction is possible even after common image attacks (JPEG compression, noise, blur).
  - **Metrics & Robustness Testing:**
  - **Imperceptibility (PSNR):**  
    - The system computes the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) between the original and watermarked image.
    - High PSNR (e.g., >40 dB) means the watermark is visually imperceptible.
    - Formula:  
      `PSNR = 20 * log10(255.0 / sqrt(MSE))`  
      where MSE is the mean squared error between original and watermarked images.
  - **Robustness (NCC):**  
    - Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) is computed between the original and extracted watermark.
    - NCC close to 1.0 means the watermark is perfectly recovered.
    - Formula:  
      `NCC = mean(sign(original_wm) * sign(recovered_wm))`
  - **Attack Simulation:**  
    - Robustness is tested against common image attacks:
      - JPEG compression (Q=85, 70, 50)
      - Gaussian noise (σ=0.03, 0.06)
      - Gaussian blur (σ=0.8, 1.2)
    - The system reports PSNR and NCC for each attack, showing how well the watermark survives.

- **Implementation:**
  - Embedding and extraction are performed on the Y channel (luminance) in YCbCr color space.
  - Watermark is embedded in DCT coefficients of DWT-LL subbands, with adaptive margin and redundancy.
  
- Outputs:
  - Watermarked images and extracted watermark images saved to disk.
  - Computed PSNR/NCC metrics for verification.

  - **Command to embed watermark:**
  python watermarkdwt.py

  - **Command to verify watermark:**
  For text watermark:
  python verify_watermark.py -i "Watermarked-image-path" -t "Text-which-was-watermarked"

  For image watermark:
  python verify_watermark.py -o "Watermarked-image-path" -t "Path-of-image-which-was-used-as-watermark"
